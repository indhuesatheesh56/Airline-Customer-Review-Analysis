Steady Growth: The data shows a steady increase in review volume from 2016 to 2019, followed by a significant decline in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The recovery in 2022 and 2023 suggests a resurgence in air travel, with customer engagement returning to pre-pandemic levels.

Seasonal Patterns: There is a noticeable seasonal trend, with a peak in reviews during the second half of the year, particularly from July to October. This indicates higher travel activity during these months, likely due to holidays and vacation periods.
